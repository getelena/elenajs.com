## Git pull requests

If you have a specific bug fix or contribution in mind, you can generate a pull request in this repository. When naming your branch, please follow the below naming convention:

- `feature/<feature-name>`
- `hotfix/<fix-name>`

## Commit message conventions

> [!NOTE]
> These are the commit message conventions we follow. Please note that the categories may still change.

- Anyone should easily understand what a commit does without reading the change itself.
- Describe what the commit does, not what issue it relates to or fixes.
- Limit the first line of the commit message (message summary) to 72 characters or less.
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature") and imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...") when providing a description of what you did.
- If your Pull Request addresses an issue, reference it in the body of the commit message.
- Do not place a period `.` at the end.

### Example

```
[$category]: Short summary of what you did

Longer description here if necessary

Fixes #1234
```

Note: Add co-authors to your commit message for commits with multiple authors

```
Co-authored-by: Name Here <email@here>
```

In the above example, `$category` is one of the categories listed below.

### Categories

- `feat`: A new feature for the repository.
- `fix`: A bug fix for an existing functionality.
- `docs`: Documentation changes, including updating readmes.
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `tests`: Adding missing tests or modifying existing ones.
- `chore`: All other changes, such as changes to the build process and libraries.
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit.

Category names are always lowercase, for consistency.
